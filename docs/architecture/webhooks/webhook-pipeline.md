title: Webhook pipeline
description: The provider-agnostic pipeline that turns an inbound webhook into dispatched workflow runs
---

The orchestrator's webhook processing pipeline turns inbound provider webhooks
into dispatched workflow runs. The pipeline is fully provider-agnostic — all
provider-specific operations (normalization, lock-file fetch, credential
minting) happen through the `ProviderRegistry` and its per-routing-key
`ProviderBundle` instances.

Entry point: `processWebhook()` in `packages/orchestrator/src/pipeline/process-webhook.ts` (re-exported from the sibling `processor.ts`, which holds the pipeline's shared helpers such as `resolveLockFileWithFallback`).

## Overview

```
request → dedup → provider normalize → extract repo/ref/credentials →
          trust resolution (PR only) → fetch lock file (with fallback) →
          trigger match → cache check → dispatch jobs → forward traces → metrics
```

Each step is a pure function called from `processWebhook()`; none of them
knows about the others. The pipeline is designed so a single entry point can
serve multiple providers (github, generic, internal) without any provider-
specific branching outside the bundles themselves.

## Pipeline steps

1. **Dedup check** — `DedupCache` rejects duplicate delivery IDs within the TTL window.
2. **Provider bundle resolution** — `providerRegistry.getByRoutingKey(info.routingKey)` maps the inbound routing key to the correct `ProviderBundle`.
3. **Event normalization** — `bundle.normalizer.normalizeEvent(...)` turns the provider-native payload into a `SimulatedEvent` (push, pull_request, …).
4. **Extract repo/ref/credentials** — `bundle.normalizer.extractRepoIdentifier`, `extractRef`, `extractCredentials`.
5. **Lock-file fetch** — via the multi-provider fallback resolver (see below).
6. **Trigger match** — `matchWorkflowsForEvent(lockFile.workflows, eventWithFiles)` against the resolved lock file. Workflows are indexed by the event type(s) their triggers subscribe to (built once per cached lock file), so only the candidates for the incoming event type are evaluated rather than every workflow. The matched set is identical to a full scan.
7. **Dispatch** — `dispatcher.dispatch(...)` routes each matched job to an agent or queue.
8. **Decision trace** — the orchestrator forwards the decision trace upstream to KiCI for dashboard visibility.
9. **Metrics** — `webhooksProcessedTotal`, `triggerMatchDurationSeconds`, etc.

## Multi-provider lock-file fallback

**Source:** `resolveLockFileWithFallback()` in `packages/orchestrator/src/pipeline/processor.ts`.

### Resolver behavior

The lock-file resolver tries the inbound webhook's provider bundle first.
When the inbound fetcher returns `null` (the repo is not present on the
inbound provider's side — typical for internal-sourced webhooks targeting
repos whose lock files live on a github provider in the same customer), the
resolver falls back to the lock-file fetchers of OTHER provider bundles
registered for the SAME customer's registrations of the SAME repo. On the
first non-null result it stops and returns the lock file. On exhaustion it
returns `null` so the `Lock file not found` branch runs (global workflow
matching, then no-op).

### Security model

Tenant isolation is structural, not procedural:

- The fallback iterates ONLY registrations returned by
  `registrationIndex.getByOrgAndRepo(customerId, repoIdentifier)`.
- That index is keyed by `${customerId}|${repoIdentifier}`. A customer B
  registration for the same `repoIdentifier` will NEVER be returned when we
  pass `customerId = 'custA'`. Cross-tenant leakage is impossible by
  construction — there is no path through the fallback that reaches a
  different customer's registration set.
- The fallback is additionally gated on `customerId !== '__default__'` so
  the global default bucket cannot accidentally serve as a cross-tenant
  staging area.
- The inbound routing key is excluded from the fallback set, preventing
  self-recursion (the same fetcher is never called twice within one webhook
  processing cycle).
- The fallback dedupes by `routingKey` so a repo with many registered
  workflows under the same source only triggers one fallback fetch.

### Ordering

Registrations are consulted in the order returned by `getByOrgAndRepo`, which
preserves insertion order (effectively `createdAt` ascending). The first
non-null lock file wins. This is deterministic; operators can predict which
bundle will serve a given webhook by inspecting the registration list.

### Credentials

Each fallback fetcher is invoked with the REGISTRATION's `providerContext`,
NOT the inbound normalizer's credentials. This is load-bearing:

- `LocalWebhookNormalizer.extractCredentials()` returns `{}`.
- `GitHubLockFileFetcher.fetchLockFile()` requires `installationId` in
  credentials and would fail on `{}`.
- The registration stores the `providerContext` from the time it was
  created, which includes the credentials its owning provider needs.

The implementation looks up the matching registration by `routingKey` and
passes `registration.providerContext` directly into `lockFileCache.get(...)`.

### Cache interaction

The shared `LockFileCache` is provider-agnostic — the cache key is
`${repoIdentifier}:${ref}`, not scoped by fetcher. This means:

- If a prior real GitHub push webhook has already populated the cache for
  `(<owner>/<repo>, <sha>)`, the fallback's call to the
  github fetcher hits the cache immediately — zero network cost.
- If the cache is cold, the fallback makes a single github API call, then
  all subsequent webhooks for the same ref hit the cache.

### Cross-provider dispatch (clone URL + clone token)

When `resolveLockFileWithFallback` resolves a lock file via a fallback
bundle, the dispatch site must use THAT bundle's `repoUrlBuilder` and
`cloneTokenProvider` — not the inbound bundle's. Without this swap, an
internal-sourced webhook resolved via a github fallback would pass
`file://` clone URLs to the agent, which fail inside container agents where
the local filesystem path does not exist.

**What is swapped at the dispatch site:**

- `bundle.repoUrlBuilder` → `fallbackBundle.repoUrlBuilder` (clone URLs)
- `credentials` → `fallbackCredentials` (the registration's
  `providerContext`, carrying `installationId` etc.)
- `effectiveRoutingKey` → `fallbackRoutingKey`
- `effectiveProvider` → `fallbackBundle.normalizer.provider`

**What is NOT swapped:**

- `changedFilesFetcher` — inbound concern (changed files detection is
  normalized from the inbound payload, not the fallback provider)
- `checkStatusPoster` — inbound context (check runs belong to the provider
  that received the original webhook)
- Registration extraction (`replaceAll`) — event-driven, uses inbound
  `bundle` and `credentials`

This mirrors the bundle-swap pattern used by cross-source dispatch in
`process-webhook.ts` (Phase B), applied to the fallback resolution path. The principle:
"the bundle that knows about the repo provides the clone credentials."

**Return type extension:** `resolveLockFileWithFallback` now returns
`fallbackBundle` (the winning `ProviderBundle`) and `fallbackCredentials`
(the registration's `providerContext` cast to `Record<string, unknown>`)
alongside the existing `fallbackRoutingKey`. These are `undefined` when
the lock file was resolved via the inbound path or not at all.

### Observability

The resolver emits structured log markers operators can grep for:

- `Lock file resolved via fallback provider bundle` (info) — on success.
  Includes `deliveryId`, `inboundRoutingKey`, `fallbackRoutingKey`,
  `repoIdentifier`, `ref`, `attemptedFallbacks`.
- `Cross-provider dispatch: using fallback bundle for clone URL + token`
  (info) — emitted at the dispatch site when the bundle swap activates.
  Includes `deliveryId`, `inboundRoutingKey`, `fallbackRoutingKey`,
  `repoIdentifier`.
- `Multi-provider fallback exhausted without resolving lock file` (info) —
  on miss after all fallbacks tried. Includes `attemptedFallbacks` count.
- `Multi-provider fallback: no same-customer registrations for repo` (info)
  — when the registration index returns nothing for the tenant.
- `Multi-provider fallback: fetcher threw, continuing` (warn) — when a
  fallback fetcher throws; processing continues with the next fallback.

Staging deploys should look for both success markers during the
`stg-ha-smoke` failover-dispatch test window — the fallback resolution
marker and the dispatch bundle swap marker together confirm the full
cross-provider pipeline is live. See `docs/internal/staging-deployment.md`
for deploy-time verification steps.

### Tests

Unit coverage in `packages/orchestrator/src/pipeline/processor.test.ts`
covers the multi-provider lock-file fallback:

1. **Success-first** — inbound succeeds → fallback not consulted.
2. **Fallback success** — inbound returns null → github fetcher called with
   the registration's `providerContext`, lock file resolved, trigger match
   fires, dispatch happens.
3. **Exhaustion** — inbound null, two fallback registrations both return
   null → existing no-lock-file path runs, no crash, zero dispatches.
4. **Strict tenant boundary** — customer A webhook, customer B has a
   matching-repo registration; fallback NEVER calls customer B's fetcher;
   `getByOrgAndRepo` is only called with `custA`.
5. **Dedupe by routingKey** — two same-tenant registrations sharing one
   routingKey → fallback fetcher called exactly once.
6. **No self-recursion** — inbound `github:42`, registration also
   `github:42` → fetcher called exactly once total (inbound only; excluded
   from fallback set).
7. **Inbound repoUrl regression** — inbound succeeds → dispatched
   job's `repoUrl` is the inbound bundle's `file://` URL, `providerContext`
   is the inbound `{}`. Regression guard for the bundle swap.
8. **Fallback repoUrl + credentials** — inbound null, fallback fires
   → dispatched job's `repoUrl` starts with `https://github.com/`,
   `providerContext` is the registration's `{installationId: 12345}`.
9. **No repoUrlBuilder fallback** — fallback bundle has
   `lockFileFetcher` but no `repoUrlBuilder` → dispatched job's `repoUrl`
   is `''` (graceful degradation, no crash).

E2E coverage via `e2e/tests/stg-ha-smoke.test.ts` failover-dispatch test
which proves the end-to-end flow against deployed staging: real push webhook
→ internal ingress → fallback resolves lock file via github bundle → trigger
match → dispatch through coord B with `https://github.com/` clone URL →
agent clones successfully → `scalerContext.scalerName.endsWith('-b')` →
run reaches terminal `completed`.
